I am Graduate Student at Rutgers Business School pursuing Master's in Information Technology & Analytics graduating in December 2020 and currently working as a Product Analyst Co-op for GlaxoSmithKline. I love in bringing life to data and thus I have strong inclination towards analyzing, interpreting and presenting the data. I believe in the personal and professional development of myself at every stage of my life.
I am actively looking out for full time opportunities in the field of data analytics, business analyst, business intelligence, project management, product analyst.

Apart from technology and business that drives me crazy, you'd most likely find me exploring the world!
